# **CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION ON STEAM GAME DATA USING TensorFlow**

**Performed EDA on the steam game dataset using Knime and created a regression and classification model using TensorFlow**

**Predicted the rating( overwhelmingly negative to overwhelmingly positive [1 - 9] ) given by users to the game based on features such as cross compatibility of game with multiple OS, release date and so on**

**The games.csv is the original dataset and steam\_game\_final.csv is the final analysed and reduced dataset**

**STEP 1: EDA and Visualization using KNIME**

1. **Loaded the dataset into Knime analytics software**
2. **Removed columns not necessary for model training such as app id, the title of the game, original price and so on**
3. **Performed EDA on the data and visualized it in form of graphs**

4. **Performed linear regression and classification on the dataset using tensorflow**

**(whose results are present in the notebook files)**
